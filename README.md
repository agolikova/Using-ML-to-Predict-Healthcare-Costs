# Using Machine Learning to Predict Healthcare Costs

The aim of this project is to predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm.

This assignment was set as part of the Machine Learning with Python Projects course on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/linear-regression-health-costs-calculator).

### Data description

File name: [insurance.csv](https://github.com/agolikova/Using-Machine-Learning-to-Predict-Healthcare-Costs/blob/main/insurance.csv). This dataset contains information about different people including their healthcare costs.

### Tasks

* Convert categorical data to numbers
* Use 80% of the data as the train_dataset and 20% of the data as the test_dataset
* Pop off the "expenses" column from these datasets to create new datasets called train_labels and test_labels. Use these labels when training your model
* Create a model and train it with the train_dataset
* Test your model using the unseen test_dataset
* To pass the challenge, model.evaluate must return a Mean Absolute Error of under 3500, meaning it predicts health care costs correctly within $3500
* Predict expenses using the test_dataset and graph the results
